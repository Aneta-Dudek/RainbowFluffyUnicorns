# Assignment: Implement user interfaces that you've designed 

By now you should have an idea of what you are going to create.
Your task at hand is to implement Views that you have already designed.

You can implement dynamic structure, animations, add life & movement on your website. **However, do NOT connect any data sources e.g. database.** For now, focus on displaying mocked/dummy data in a user-friendly way. Remember about cleancode and ES6 standards in your implementation.

### GIT
Together, you need to create a team and init a git repository on classroom:
https://classroom.github.com/g/NelnkFYt
From master, start a new branch named **views** and put all HTML,CSS and JS files in there. 

### HTML Snippets
Probably you'll implement very similar views or have duplicated elements. To avoid repetition of your HTML code, you can include HTML snippets and reuse whole blocks: [Include HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_include.asp)

### 3rd party
During this project you are NOT allowed to use any 3rd party libraries like **Bootstrap** or JQuery.
