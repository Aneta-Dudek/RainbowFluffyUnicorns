# Introduction to the Quest Store


### Dear Codecoolers,

You have strong basics of Object-Oriented
Paradigm. You use Git on a daily basis, the teams work in scrum.
You give and receive feedbacks, demonstrate your work to each other,
and constantly work on making your teams performing better.

This was an exhausting 6 months, but the next half year won't be less relaxing
either! It's high time for a long-time project (around 2 months). So let's get ready to rumbleeeeee, and start programming a Full-stack Web application!

Apart from implementation of new technologies, during each sprint you'll add more
functionalities to your system. Every evaluation will depend on mentor's requirements and goals, which you'll set down. The main goal is to deliver on time a working application
which fulfills requirements.

## The Quests

These are the achievements that give you coolcoins (cc). There are 2 types of
challenges: basics and extras. The first type has a consistent frequency and provide
a basic income. The extras are opportunities to get more Coolcoins beyond recurring quests.

### Basic Quests
