# Assignment: QuestStore: Planning

## Analysis and Design

Your task is to design Quest Store system. Thankfully Product Owner collected the requirements in the following user
stories [file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ZQtisJ0zQ1yzluqfP7XQAM0Z-MQZe9N/edit).

During the **Project Planning**, you have to:
  * research the requirements (*imperative)
  * prepare the list of Views
  * prepare HTML mocks for your application (*imperative)
  * prepare an ERD for SQL database
  * *prepare an UML class diagram along with your application architecture (this step is optional, but you will have to do this eventually)

During next weeks you will be implementing front-end as well as back-end functionalities, therefore you have to keep in mind the whole scope of your application.

## Requirements

Meet in your team and a create product backlog on [Taiga](https://taiga.io), [Trello](https://trello.com/) or any other online Kanban tool.

## List of Views

Create a list of views for the current version of your Questore System project that you will have to implement in next step. How? Just simply go through what you have done already and focus on user interface that is necessary to implement the requirements / user stories. Write down everything where single view might be necessary.

### Example

How does the list might look like?

  * login page,
  * dashboard with a menu,
  * students list,
  * add new or edit student form,
  * mentors list
  * etc, etc...

## Layout Mockups

Create mockups for every view.  
There is plenty of applications that can help you with that. Pick one that best suits you:

You can even use well known [draw.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDPDIPj5XWY) 
Try to design user-friendly layouts, reach out and collect feedback about your UI/UX from other people.

## ERD & UML Class Diagram

Requirements, views, SQL entities, experience gathered so far - they are your guide here.
Start small and build on that.
